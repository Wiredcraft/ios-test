# Mobile Test - GitHub Users List App

Thank you very much. I have the opportunity to practice a small project. I will explain the current project completion status as follows:
1. The UI of the project (githup_list, github_user_detail) has been completed;
2. The follow and unfollow buttons on the github_list page just make a switching effect;
3. The search, pull-up loading, and pull-down refresh functions of the github_list page have been completed.

# Run
Compile and run directly with xcode！At present, I use iPhone8plus, iPhone11 pro, iPhone12, iPhone13 pro simulator for testing, and it can run normally.
