In this project, i'm trying to use RxSwift with MVVM to implement this feature.

I separated this project in 3 parts: Models, ViewModels, Views & ViewControllers.

In Models part, I declared a Class (WCTUserModel) to store user information.
And a Struct (FetchUserResponseData) to store ApiResponse. Because ApiResponse should be a simple value.

In ViewModels Part, I declared a network service class to connect to Api Server. A tableViewCellModel to configure tableViewCell.
And a HomeViewModel to handle all the event in homeViewController.
In HomeViewModel, I use "searchBarText" to reflect the text change of searchbar, use "cellModels" to store cellModels,
use "endHeaderRefresh" and "endFooterLoad" to control pull down refresh and pull up load more.

In view and viewControllers, I configure UI and combine HomeViewModel with HomeViewController.
